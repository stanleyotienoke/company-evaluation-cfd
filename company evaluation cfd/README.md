# 📊 DCF Master – Company Valuation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis** to estimate the intrinsic value of a company.  
DCF is a fundamental valuation method in finance, where future cash flows are projected and discounted back to present value using a chosen discount rate.

The project applies DCF modelling to real company data (e.g., Safaricom PLC, Equity Bank, or any other firm of interest) and showcases how financial analysts use forecasting and valuation techniques to support investment decisions.

---

## Objectives
- Build a **DCF model** using Python and/or Excel.
- Forecast company free cash flows over a 5–10 year horizon.
- Apply a **discount rate (WACC)** to calculate present value.
- Estimate **terminal value** and overall enterprise value.
- Compare intrinsic value with market capitalization.

---

## Features
- 📈 **Cash Flow Forecasting** – Projecting revenue, expenses, and free cash flows.  
- 🧮 **Discounting Mechanism** – Applying Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).  
- 📊 **Valuation Outputs** – Enterprise value, equity value, and per-share value.  
- 📉 **Sensitivity Analysis** – Testing different discount rates and growth assumptions.  
- 📑 **Documentation** – Clear explanation of assumptions and methodology.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib (for calculations and visualization).  
- **Excel**: Financial modelling templates and charts.  
- **GitHub**: Version control and portfolio showcase.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`DCF_Model.ipynb`) or Excel file (`DCF_Model.xlsx`).  
3. Replace sample data with your chosen company’s financials.  
4. Run the model to generate valuation outputs.  
5. Review charts and sensitivity analysis.

## Example Output
- Intrinsic Value per Share: KES 42.50  
- Market Price per Share: KES 38.00  
- Recommendation: **Undervalued – Potential Buy**

*(Note: Replace with your actual results once you run the model.)*
